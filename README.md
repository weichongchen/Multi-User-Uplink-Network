# Multi-User-Uplink-Network
User Grouping in Wireless Multi-User Uplink Network

– Constructed a system which distributes more resources on highly involved users according to monitored historical traffic (updates monitored traffic pattern with moving average) through both MATLAB and NS3.

– Improved 20% of performance (multi-user uplink PHY-layer throughput) compared to previous work in WSN with sparse traffic pattern, on the other hand, it performs the same with intense traffic pattern.
